# Web ðŸ¥”
I'm a French web dev primarily working on web apps and tools to make my life and that of others easier.

## Realised stuff
### Projects
- [Setlist](https://setlist.warths.fr/) / [Setlist Backend](https://github.com/Ragnar-Oock/setlist_v2_connexion) : a small Vue 2 app to look for and request songs to be played on a Twitch guitar livestream
### CodePen experimentations
- a demo of how to use named grid tracks to have overlapping `grid-area` : [grid overlap](https://codepen.io/ragnar_ock/pen/YzbqOmK)
- a CSS-only digital clock (it can't drift like setTimeout based clock!) : [CSS only digital clock](https://codepen.io/ragnar_ock/pen/YzLOYNG)
- bent scrolling list : [skew list experiment](https://codepen.io/ragnar_ock/pen/eYzpLWp)
- colorful spot funk : [funk overload](https://codepen.io/ragnar_ock/pen/MWyqZeQ)

## Work in progress
- [CSS Grid Generator](https://github.com/Ragnar-Oock/css-grid-generator) : spreading the love for the [`grid-template`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template) shorthand by explaining it visually and providing a WYSIWYG style editor
- [xoram](https://github.com/Ragnar-Oock/xoram) : a minimalist plugin framework to build modular apps, [checkout the doc](https://xoram.dev/)

## Future experiments
- [`Web Animation API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) + [`Canvas`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)/[`WebGL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) : explore the use of WAAPI with canvas-based rendering for applications and websites
- a CSS [`Formal syntax`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Value_definition_syntax) explainer to demystify it and make it less cryptic for everyone (but mostly for myself)
- more to come

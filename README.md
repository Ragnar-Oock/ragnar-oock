- [CSS Grid Generator](https://github.com/Ragnar-Oock/css-grid-generator) : spreading the love for the [`grid-template`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template) shorthand by explaining it visually and providing a WYSIWYG style editor

## Future experiments

- a CSS [`Formal syntax`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Value_definition_syntax) explainer to demystify it and make it less cryptic for everyone (but mostly for myself)
- more to come
